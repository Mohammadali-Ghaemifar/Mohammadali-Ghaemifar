# Hi, I'm Mohammadali Ghaemifar 👋  
Control Systems • Robotics • Deep Reinforcement Learning • Indoor Positioning

I work at the intersection of **adaptive & nonlinear control**, **teleoperation**, **deep RL**, and **localization**.  
My research focuses on building robust, learning-based controllers for uncertain robotic systems and perception-driven navigation.
